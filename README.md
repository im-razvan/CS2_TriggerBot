# CS2_TriggerBot

Simple CS2 TriggerBot W/O Memory Writing

## Is it safe?
I've personally never been banned while using it, but I can't say it's safe. Use at your own risk.

## How to execute it?
Simply perform a `pip install -r requirements.txt` and proceed to run the Python script.
You can change the trigger key by changing the [`settings.ini`](settings.ini) file. Refer to [Microsoft Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes) for the key codes.
